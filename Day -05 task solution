Create Directories Using Shell Script:

Write a bash script createDirectories.sh that, when executed with three arguments (directory name, start number of directories, and end number of directories), creates a specified number of directories with a dynamic directory name.
Example 1: When executed as ./createDirectories.sh day 1 90, it creates 90 directories as day1 day2 day3 ... day90.
Example 2: When executed as ./createDirectories.sh Movie 20 50, it creates 31 directories as Movie20 Movie21 Movie22 ... Movie50.
Notes: You may need to use loops or commands (or both), based on your preference. Check out this reference: Bash Scripting For Loop

#!/bin/bash

n=$2

for ((i=$1; i<=n;i++));
do
        echo "$3 $i"

done
